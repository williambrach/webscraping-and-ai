Though with *public data* and *simple models*, machine learning technologies **work very well** in practical Quant investment.\\n\\nHere is a quick **[demo](https://terminalizer.com/view/3f24561a4470)** shows how to install ``Qlib``, and run LightGBM with ``qrun``. **But**, please make sure you have already prepared the data following the [instruction](#data-preparation).\\n\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nThis table demonstrates the supported Python version of `Qlib`:\\n|               | install with pip      | install from source  |        plot        |\\n| ------------- |:---------------------:|:--------------------:|:------------------:|\\n| Python 3.8    | :heavy_check_mark:    | :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark: |\\n| Python 3.9    | :heavy_check_mark:    | :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark: |\\n| Python 3.10   | :heavy_check_mark:    | :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark: |\\n| Python 3.11   | :heavy_check_mark:    | :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark: |\\n| Python 3.12   | :heavy_check_mark:    | :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark: |\\n\\n**Note**: \\n1. **Conda** is suggested for managing your Python environment. In some cases, using Python outside of a `conda` environment may result in missing header files, causing the installation failure of certain packages.\\n2. Please pay attention that installing cython in Python 3.6 will raise some error when installing ``Qlib`` from source. If users use Python 3.6 on their machines, it is recommended to *upgrade* Python to version 3.8 or higher, or use `conda`\\'s Python to install ``Qlib`` from source.\\n\\n### Install with pip\\nUsers can easily install ``Qlib`` by pip according to the following command.\\n\\n```bash\\n  pip install pyqlib\\n```\\n\\n**Note**: pip will install the latest stable qlib. However, the main branch of qlib is in active development. If you want to test the latest scripts or functions in the main branch. Please install qlib with the methods below.\\n\\n### Install from source\\nAlso, users can install the latest dev version ``Qlib`` by the source code according to the following steps:\\n\\n* Before installing ``Qlib`` from source, users need to install some dependencies:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  pip install numpy\\n  pip install --upgrade cython\\n  ```\\n\\n* Clone the repository and install ``Qlib`` as follows.\\n    ```bash\\n    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/qlib.git && cd qlib\\n    pip install .  # `pip install -e .[dev]` is recommended for development. check details in docs/developer/code_standard_and_dev_guide.rst\\n    ```\\n\\n**Tips**: If you fail to install `Qlib` or run the examples in your environment,  comparing your steps and the [CI workflow](.github/workflows/test_qlib_from_source.yml) may help you find the problem.\\n\\n**Tips for Mac**: If you are using Mac with M1, you might encounter issues in building the wheel for LightGBM, which is due to missing dependencies from OpenMP. To solve the problem, install openmp first with ``brew install libomp`` and then run ``pip install .`` to build it successfully. \\n\\n## Data Preparation\\n‚ùó Due to more restrict data security policy. The offical dataset is disabled temporarily. You can try [this data source](https://github.com/chenditc/investment_data/releases) contributed by the community.\\nHere is an example to download the latest data.\\n```bash\\nwget https://github.com/chenditc/investment_data/releases/latest/download/qlib_bin.tar.gz\\nmkdir -p ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data\\ntar -zxvf qlib_bin.tar.gz -C ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data --strip-components=1\\nrm -f qlib_bin.tar.gz\\n```\\n\\nThe official dataset below will resume in short future.\\n\\n\\n----\\n\\nLoad and prepare data by running the following code:\\n\\n### Get with module\\n  ```bash\\n  # get 1d data\\n  python -m qlib.run.get_data qlib_data --target_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data --region cn\\n\\n  # get 1min data\\n  python -m qlib.run.get_data qlib_data --target_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data_1min --region cn --interval 1min\\n\\n  ```\\n\\n### Get from source\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  # get 1d data\\n  python scripts/get_data.py qlib_data --target_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data --region cn\\n\\n  # get 1min data\\n  python scripts/get_data.py qlib_data --target_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data_1min --region cn --interval 1min\\n\\n  ```\\n\\nThis dataset is created by public data collected by [crawler scripts](scripts/data_collector/), which have been released in\\nthe same repository.\\nUsers could create the same dataset with it.

You can start an auto quant research workflow and have a graphical reports analysis according to the following steps: \\n\\n1. Quant Research Workflow: Run  `qrun` with lightgbm workflow config ([workflow_config_lightgbm_Alpha158.yaml](examples/benchmarks/LightGBM/workflow_config_lightgbm_Alpha158.yaml) as following.\\n    ```bash\\n      cd examples  # Avoid running program under the directory contains `qlib`\\n      qrun benchmarks/LightGBM/workflow_config_lightgbm_Alpha158.yaml\\n    ```\\n    If users want to use `qrun` under debug mode, please use the following command:\\n    ```bash\\n    python -m pdb qlib/workflow/cli.py examples/benchmarks/LightGBM/workflow_config_lightgbm_Alpha158.yaml\\n    ```\\n    The result of `qrun` is as follows, please refer to [docs](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/strategy.html#result) for more explanations about the result. \\n\\n    ```bash\\n\\n    \\'The following are analysis results of the excess return without cost.\\'\\n                           risk\\n    mean               0.000708\\n    std                0.005626\\n    annualized_return  0.178316\\n    information_ratio  1.996555\\n    max_drawdown      -0.081806\\n    \\'The following are analysis results of the excess return with cost.\\'\\n                           risk\\n    mean               0.000512\\n    std                0.005626\\n    annualized_return  0.128982\\n    information_ratio  1.444287\\n    max_drawdown      -0.091078\\n    ```\\n    Here are detailed documents for `qrun` and [workflow](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/workflow.html).\\n\\n2. Graphical Reports Analysis: First, run `python -m pip install .[analysis]` to install the required dependencies. Then run `examples/workflow_by_code.ipynb` with `jupyter notebook` to get graphical reports. \\n    - Forecasting signal (model prediction) analysis\\n      - Cumulative Return of groups\\n      ![Cumulative Return](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/docs/_static/img/analysis/analysis_model_cumulative_return.png)\\n      - Return distribution\\n      ![long_short](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/docs/_static/img/analysis/analysis_model_long_short.png)\\n      - Information Coefficient (IC)\\n      ![Information Coefficient](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/docs/_static/img/analysis/analysis_model_IC.png)\\n      ![Monthly IC](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/docs/_static/img/analysis/analysis_model_monthly_IC.png)\\n      ![IC](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/docs/_static/img/analysis/analysis_model_NDQ.png)\\n      - Auto Correlation of forecasting signal (model prediction)\\n      ![Auto Correlation](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/docs/_static/img/analysis/analysis_model_auto_correlation.png)\\n\\n    - Portfolio analysis\\n      - Backtest return\\n      ![Report](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/docs/_static/img/analysis/report.png)\\n      <!-- \\n      - Score IC\\n      ![Score IC](docs/_static/img/score_ic.png)\\n      - Cumulative Return\\n      ![Cumulative Return](docs/_static/img/cumulative_return.png)\\n      - Risk Analysis\\n      ![Risk Analysis](docs/_static/img/risk_analysis.png)\\n      - Rank Label\\n      ![Rank Label](docs/_static/img/rank_label.png)\\n      -->\\n   - [Explanation](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/report.html) of above results\\n\\n## Building Customized Quant Research Workflow by Code\\nThe automatic workflow may not suit the research workflow of all Quant researchers. To support a flexible Quant research workflow, Qlib also provides a modularized interface to allow researchers to build their own workflow by code. [Here](examples/workflow_by_code.ipynb) is a demo for customized Quant research workflow by code.\\n\\n# Main Challenges & Solutions in Quant Research\\nQuant investment is a very unique scenario with lots of key challenges to be solved.\\nCurrently, Qlib provides some solutions for several of them.\\n\\n## Forecasting: Finding Valuable Signals/Patterns\\nAccurate forecasting of the stock price trend is a very important part to construct profitable portfolios.\\nHowever, huge amount of data with various formats in the financial market which make it challenging to build forecasting models.\\n\\nAn increasing number of SOTA Quant research works/papers, which focus on building forecasting models to mine valuable signals/patterns in complex financial data, are released in `Qlib`\\n\\n\\n### [Quant Model (Paper) Zoo](examples/benchmarks)\\n\\nHere is a list of models built on `Qlib`.\\n- [GBDT based on XGBoost (Tianqi Chen, et al.

Users can find the config files we provide and some details about the model through the [benchmarks](examples/benchmarks) folder. More information can be retrieved at the model files listed above.\\n\\n`Qlib` provides three different ways to run a single model, users can pick the one that fits their cases best:\\n- Users can use the tool `qrun` mentioned above to run a model\\'s workflow based from a config file.\\n- Users can create a `workflow_by_code` python script based on the [one](examples/workflow_by_code.py) listed in the `examples` folder.\\n\\n- Users can use the script [`run_all_model.py`](examples/run_all_model.py) listed in the `examples` folder to run a model. Here is an example of the specific shell command to be used: `python run_all_model.py run --models=lightgbm`, where the `--models` arguments can take any number of models listed above(the available models can be found  in [benchmarks](examples/benchmarks/)). For more use cases, please refer to the file\\'s [docstrings](examples/run_all_model.py).\\n    - **NOTE**: Each baseline has different environment dependencies, please make sure that your python version aligns with the requirements(e.g. TFT only supports Python 3.6~3.7 due to the limitation of `tensorflow==1.15.0`)\\n\\n### Run multiple models\\n`Qlib` also provides a script [`run_all_model.py`](examples/run_all_model.py) which can run multiple models for several iterations. (**Note**: the script only support *Linux* for now. Other OS will be supported in the future. Besides, it doesn\\'t support parallel running the same model for multiple times as well, and this will be fixed in the future development too.)\\n\\nThe script will create a unique virtual environment for each model, and delete the environments after training. Thus, only experiment results such as `IC` and `backtest` results will be generated and stored.\\n\\nHere is an example of running all the models for 10 iterations:\\n```python\\npython run_all_model.py run 10\\n```\\n\\nIt also provides the API to run specific models at once. For more use cases, please refer to the file\\'s [docstrings](examples/run_all_model.py). \\n\\n### Break change\\nIn `pandas`, `group_key` is one of the parameters of the `groupby` method. From version 1.5 to 2.0 of `pandas`, the default value of `group_key` has been changed from `no default` to `True`, which will cause qlib to report an error during operation. So we set `group_key=False`, but it doesn\\'t guarantee that some programmes will run correctly, including:\\n* qlib\\\\examples\\\\rl_order_execution\\\\scripts\\\\gen_training_orders.py\\n* qlib\\\\examples\\\\benchmarks\\\\TRA\\\\src\\\\dataset.MTSDatasetH.py\\n* qlib\\\\examples\\\\benchmarks\\\\TFT\\\\tft.py\\n\\n\\n\\n## [Adapting to Market Dynamics](examples/benchmarks_dynamic)\\n\\nDue to the non-stationary nature of the environment of the financial market, the data distribution may change in different periods, which makes the performance of models build on training data decays in the future test data.\\nSo adapting the forecasting models/strategies to market dynamics is very important to the model/strategies\\' performance.\\n\\nHere is a list of solutions built on `Qlib`.\\n- [Rolling Retraining](examples/benchmarks_dynamic/baseline/)\\n- [DDG-DA on pytorch (Wendi, et al. AAAI 2022)](examples/benchmarks_dynamic/DDG-DA/)\\n\\n##  Reinforcement Learning: modeling continuous decisions\\nQlib now supports reinforcement learning, a feature designed to model continuous investment decisions. This functionality assists investors in optimizing their trading strategies by learning from interactions with the environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.\\n\\nHere is a list of solutions built on `Qlib` categorized by scenarios.\\n\\n### [RL for order execution](examples/rl_order_execution)\\n[Here](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/rl/overall.html#order-execution) is the introduction of this scenario.

They are learned based on the `Learning Framework` layer and then applied to multiple scenarios in `Workflow` layer.\\nThe learning framework leverages the `Workflow` layer as well(e.g. sharing `Information Extractor`, creating environments based on `Execution Env`).\\n\\nBased on learning paradigms, they can be categorized into reinforcement learning and supervised learning.\\n- For supervised learning, the detailed docs can be found [here](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/model.html).\\n- For reinforcement learning, the detailed docs can be found [here](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/rl.html). Qlib\\'s RL learning framework leverages `Execution Env` in `Workflow` layer to create environments.  It\\'s worth noting that `NestedExecutor` is supported as well. This empowers users to optimize different level of strategies/models/agents together (e.g. optimizing an order execution strategy for a specific portfolio management strategy).\\n\\n\\n# More About Qlib\\nIf you want to have a quick glance at the most frequently used components of qlib, you can try notebooks [here](examples/tutorial/).\\n\\nThe detailed documents are organized in [docs](docs/).\\n[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) and the readthedocs theme is required to build the documentation in html formats. \\n```bash\\ncd docs/\\nconda install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme -y\\n# Otherwise, you can install them with pip\\n# pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme\\nmake html\\n```\\nYou can also view the [latest document](http://qlib.readthedocs.io/) online directly.\\n\\nQlib is in active and continuing development. Our plan is in the roadmap, which is managed as a [github project](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/projects/1).\\n\\n\\n\\n# Offline Mode and Online Mode\\nThe data server of Qlib can either deployed as `Offline` mode or `Online` mode. The default mode is offline mode.\\n\\nUnder `Offline` mode, the data will be deployed locally. \\n\\nUnder `Online` mode, the data will be deployed as a shared data service. The data and their cache will be shared by all the clients. The data retrieval performance is expected to be improved due to a higher rate of cache hits. It will consume less disk space, too. The documents of the online mode can be found in [Qlib-Server](https://qlib-server.readthedocs.io/). The online mode can be deployed automatically with [Azure CLI based scripts](https://qlib-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html#one-click-deployment-in-azure). The source code of online data server can be found in [Qlib-Server repository](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib-server).\\n\\n## Performance of Qlib Data Server\\nThe performance of data processing is important to data-driven methods like AI technologies. As an AI-oriented platform, Qlib provides a solution for data storage and data processing. To demonstrate the performance of Qlib data server, we\\ncompare it with several other data storage solutions. \\n\\nWe evaluate the performance of several storage solutions by finishing the same task,\\nwhich creates a dataset (14 features/factors) from the basic OHLCV daily data of a stock market (800 stocks each day from 2007 to 2020). The task involves data queries and processing.\\n\\n|                         | HDF5      | MySQL     | MongoDB   | InfluxDB  | Qlib -E -D  | Qlib +E -D   | Qlib +E +D  |\\n| --                      | ------    | ------    | --------  | --------- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------- |\\n| Total (1CPU) (seconds)  | 184.4¬±3.7 | 365.3¬±7.5 | 253.6¬±6.7 | 368.2¬±3.6 | 147.0¬±8.8   | 47.6¬±1.0     | **7.4¬±0.3** |\\n| Total (64CPU) (seconds) |           |           |           |           | 8.8¬±0.6     | **4.2¬±0.2**  |             |\\n* `+(-)E` indicates with (out) `ExpressionCache`\\n* `+(-)D` indicates with (out) `DatasetCache`\\n\\nMost general-purpose databases take too much time to load data. After looking into the underlying implementation, we find that data go through too many layers of interfaces and unnecessary format transformations in general-purpose database solutions.\\nSuch overheads greatly slow down the data loading process.\\nQlib data are stored in a compact format, which is efficient to be combined into arrays for scientific computation.\\n\\n# Related Reports\\n- [Guide To Qlib: Microsoft‚Äôs AI Investment Platform](https://analyticsindiamag.com/qlib/)\\n- [ÂæÆËΩØ‰πüÊêûAIÈáèÂåñÂπ≥Âè∞ÔºüËøòÊòØÂºÄÊ∫êÁöÑÔºÅ](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/47bP5YwxfTp2uTHjUBzJQQ)\\n- [ÂæÆÁüøQlibÔºö‰∏öÂÜÖÈ¶ñ‰∏™AIÈáèÂåñÊäïËµÑÂºÄÊ∫êÂπ≥Âè∞](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/vsJv7lsgjEi-ALYUz4CvtQ)\\n\\n# Contact Us\\n- If you have any issues, please create issue [here](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/issues/new/choose) or send messages in [gitter](https://gitter.im/Microsoft/qlib).\\n- If you want to make contributions to `Qlib`, please [create pull requests](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/compare). \\n- For other reasons, you are welcome to contact us by email([qlib@microsoft.com](mailto:qlib@microsoft.com)).\\n  - We are recruiting new members(both FTEs and interns), your resumes are welcome!\\n\\nJoin IM discussion groups:\\n|[Gitter](https://gitter.im/Microsoft/qlib)|\\n|----|\\n|![image](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/docs/_static/img/qrcode/gitter_qr.png)|\\n\\n# Contributing\\nWe appreciate all contributions and thank all the contributors!\\n<a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/graphs/contributors\"><img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=microsoft/qlib\" /></a>\\n\\nBefore we released Qlib as an open-source project on Github in Sep 2020, Qlib is an internal project in our group.

And yes, you can customize it to your heart\\'s content.\\n\\n  * [Using Docker Desktop](https://docs.mindsdb.com/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop). This is the fastest and recommended way to get started and have it all running.\\n  * [Using Docker](https://docs.mindsdb.com/setup/self-hosted/docker). This is also simple, but gives you more flexibility on how to further customize your server.\\n  * [Using PyPI](https://docs.mindsdb.com/contribute/install). This option enables you to contribute to MindsDB.\\n\\n## Connect Your Data\\n\\nYou can connect to hundreds of [data sources (learn more)](https://docs.mindsdb.com/integrations/data-overview). This is just an example of a Postgres database.\\n\\n```sql\\n-- Connect to demo postgres DB\\nCREATE DATABASE demo_postgres_db\\nWITH ENGINE = \"postgres\",\\nPARAMETERS = {\\n  \"user\": \"demo_user\",\\n  \"password\": \"demo_password\",\\n  \"host\": \"samples.mindsdb.com\",\\n  \"port\": \"5432\",\\n  \"database\": \"demo\",\\n  \"schema\": \"demo_data\"\\n};\\n```\\n\\nOnce you\\'ve connected your data sources, you can [combine](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/sql/api/join-on), [slice it, dice it](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/sql/api/select), and [transform](https://docs.mindsdb.com/use-cases/data_enrichment/overview) it however your heart desires using good ol\\' standard SQL [(learn more)](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/overview). \\n\\nAfter you\\'ve whipped your data into shape, it\\'s time to build AI that actually learns!\\n\\n## Build AI Knowledge\\n\\nOur Knowledge Bases are state-of-the-art autonomous RAG systems that can digest data from any source MindsDB supports. Whether your data is structured and neater than a Swiss watch factory or unstructured and messy as a teenager\\'s bedroom, our Knowledge Base engine will figure out how to find the relevant information. \\n\\n**In this example** we will create a knowledge base that knows everything about amazon reviews. \\n\\n```sql\\n-- first create a knowledge base\\nCREATE KNOWLEDGE_BASE mindsdb.reviews_kb;\\n\\n-- now insert everything from the amazon reviews table into it, so it can learn it\\nINSERT INTO mindsdb.reviews_kb (\\n  SELECT review as content FROM demo_pg_db.amazon_reviews\\n);\\n\\n-- check the status of your loads here\\nSELECT * FROM information_schema.knowledge_bases;\\n\\n-- query the content of the knowledge base\\nSELECT * FROM mindsdb.reviews_kb;\\n```\\n\\nFor the tinkerers and optimization enthusiasts out there, you can dive as deep as you want. [(Learn more about knowledge Bases)](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/agents/knowledge-bases)\\n\\n+ Want to [hand-pick your embedding model? Go for it](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/agents/knowledge-bases#knowledge-base-with-openai-embedding-model)! \\n+ Have strong [opinions about vector databases? We\\'re here for it!](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/agents/knowledge-bases#knowledge-base-with-custom-vector-store). \\n\\nBut if you\\'d rather spend your time on other things (like finally building that billion-dollar AI App), that\\'s perfectly fine too. By default, it\\'s all handled automatically - you don\\'t need to worry about the nitty-gritty details like data embedding, chunking, vector optimization, etc.\\n\\n## Search \\n\\nNow that your knowledge base is loaded and ready. Let\\'s hunt for some juicy info!\\n\\n#### Via SQL\\n\\n```sql\\n-- Find the reviews that about Iphone in beast of lights\\nSELECT *  FROM mindsdb.reviews_kb\\nWHERE content LIKE \\'what are the best kindle reviews\\'\\nLIMIT 10;\\n```\\n\\n#### Via Python SDK\\n\\nInstall MindsDB SDK\\n\\n```shell\\npip install mindsdb_sdk\\n```\\n\\nYou can call this AI knowledge base from your app with the following code:\\n\\n```python\\nimport mindsdb_sdk\\n\\n\\n# connects to the specified host and port\\nserver = mindsdb_sdk.connect(\\'http://127.0.0.1:47334\\')\\n\\nmy_kb = server.knowledge_bases.get(\\'mindsdb.reviews_kb\\');\\ndf = my_kb.find(\\'what are the best kindle reviews\\').fetch()\\n\\n```\\n\\n## ü§ù Contribute\\n\\nInterested in contributing to MindsDB?
